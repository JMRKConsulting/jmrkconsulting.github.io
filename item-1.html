		<h2>Our Story</h2>
		<em>A passion for impact.</em>
		<p>
			J. M. R. K. The four letters that form our organization
represent the names of each of our co-founders: John Kim,
Amit (Mitty) Iyer, Richard Hamrick, and Kaan Aykac. We
first met when we decided to compete in KPMGâ€™s
International Case Competition. We did not know it at the
time, but our decision to join forces and compete together
would forever change our lives. After months of hard
work, we became the 2017 National Champions out of 42
universities, and it was on the very plane ride back from
New York City that we knew that we could not stop there.
And so, JMRK Consulting was born.
